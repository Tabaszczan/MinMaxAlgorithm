# MinMaxAlgorithm
Algorithm MinMax for game 
Game is something similar to blackjack, but we have only two players, 'Prot' and 'Ant', and we can choose only 4 5 or 6.
First move is for 'Prot', choose number and then 'Ant' choose.
We sum points that players choose.
Game will end if player that choose number get sum greater than 21 then he loses.
If sum is equal 21 then it's draw.
